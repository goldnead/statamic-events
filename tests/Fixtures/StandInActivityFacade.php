/*
 * A stand-in for statamic-activity's facade.
 *
 * The real addon is a `suggest`, not a requirement — the whole point of the
 * bridge is that a concert calendar on an artist's website installs without an
 * audit trail — so it is not in require-dev either. Declaring the class the
 * bridge probes for is what lets the *attached* path be tested at all.
 *
 * It records into a static array rather than pretending to be a ledger. What is
 * under test is the bridge: which facts cross, under which event type, with
 * which subject, brand and dedupe key. How activity stores them is activity's
 * own suite's problem.
 *
 * Loaded once from tests/Pest.php, before any test runs, so `class_exists()`
 * gives every test in the run the same answer. A fixture that declared itself
 * lazily would make the result depend on file order.
