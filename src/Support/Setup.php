/**
 * The check a CP listing runs before its first query.
 *
 * This addon can be installed without its migrations having run — composer
 * pulls the package in, the nav item appears, and `events` and
 * `event_occurrences` still do not exist. The listing asks the tables a
 * question while the page is being built, so the visitor gets HTTP 500 and a
 * stack trace for what is really an unfinished setup.
 *
 * A missing table is an operator's to-do and it owes the reader a sentence
 * instead. But the reason must not vanish along with the crash: every guarded
 * page that turns somebody away writes why to the log first. A page that shows
 * an empty state and says nothing anywhere would be worse than the 500 it
 * replaced — the site would look installed and never work.
